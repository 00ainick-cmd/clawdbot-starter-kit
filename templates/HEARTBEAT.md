# HEARTBEAT.md - Proactive Check-ins

When a heartbeat fires, follow this checklist.

---

## Quick Checks

### 1. Memory Scan
- Read last 2-3 entries in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Check for stalled items or follow-ups needed

### 2. Open Loops
- Anything mentioned but not resolved?
- Any deadlines approaching?

### 3. Proactive Surfacing
Pick 1-2 if relevant:
- "You mentioned X — any update?"
- "Deadline for Y is coming up"
- "This connects to that thing from [date]"
